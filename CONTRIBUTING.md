# Contributing to Veloria UI

Thanks for wanting to contribute! Veloria UI is a personal open-source project
by [JohnDev19](https://github.com/JohnDev19) and contributions are genuinely
welcome — bug fixes, new components, docs improvements, whatever you've got.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JohnDev19/Veloria-UI.git
cd Veloria UI
npm install
npm run build
```

## Repo structure

- `packages/core` — the `@veloria-ui/core` npm package (all 102 components live here)
- `cli` — the `@veloria-ui/cli` npm package

## Adding a new component

1. Create the component file inside the right category under `src/components/`
2. Re-export it from that category's `index.tsx`
3. Add the named export to `packages/core/src/index.ts`
4. Register it in `cli/src/registry.ts` with its deps and category
5. Export TypeScript types properly

## Code standards

- TypeScript strict mode — no `any` unless truly necessary
- All components must use `React.forwardRef`
- ARIA attributes on every interactive element — test with a screen reader if you can
- Support `asChild` via Radix `Slot` for composable use cases
- No hardcoded colors — everything goes through CSS custom properties
- Use `cn()` from `utils/cn.ts` for class merging, never string concatenation

## Commit style

```
