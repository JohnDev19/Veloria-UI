## [0.1.5] — 2026-03-17

### React Hook Form Adapter — `veloria-ui/rhf`

A new optional sub-path export that provides zero-boilerplate `Controller` wrappers for every Veloria UI form component. Import from `veloria-ui/rhf` — requires `react-hook-form ^7.0.0` as an optional peer dependency.

**11 wrappers shipped:**

| Wrapper | Wraps | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| `RhfInput` | `Input` + `FormField` | All `InputProps` forwarded (size, leftElement, rightElement…) |
| `RhfTextArea` | `TextArea` + `FormField` | Full resize/rows control |
| `RhfSelect` | Radix `Select` + `FormField` | `onValueChange` bridged to `field.onChange` |
| `RhfCheckbox` | `Checkbox` + `FormField` | Boolean field — `checked` ↔ `field.value` |
| `RhfSwitch` | `Switch` + `FormField` | Same boolean mapping as `RhfCheckbox` |
| `RhfRadioGroup` | `RadioGroup` + `FormField` | `onValueChange` → `field.onChange` |
| `RhfSlider` | `Slider` + `FormField` | Stores plain `number`, converts to `number[]` internally |
| `RhfCombobox` | `Combobox` + `FormField` | `onChange` bridged to `field.onChange` |
| `RhfMultiSelect` | `MultiSelect` + `FormField` | Field value is `string[]` |
| `RhfRatingInput` | `RatingInput` + `FormField` | Numeric value |
| `RhfOTPInput` | `OTPInput` + `FormField` | String value |

Every wrapper automatically maps `fieldState.error` to the component's `invalid` prop and renders `<FormError>` with the message. All original visual props (`size`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, `label`, etc.) pass straight through — no new API surface to learn.

**Usage:**

```tsx
import { useForm } from "react-hook-form";
import { RhfInput, RhfSelect, RhfCheckbox } from "veloria-ui/rhf";

const { control, handleSubmit } = useForm<{ email: string; role: string; agree: boolean }>();

<form onSubmit={handleSubmit(onSubmit)}>
  <RhfInput    name="email"  control={control} label="Email" type="email" />
  <RhfSelect   name="role"   control={control} label="Role"  options={roles} />
  <RhfCheckbox name="agree"  control={control} label="I agree to the terms" />
</form>
```

### Build

- `veloria-ui/rhf` entry added to `exports` map in `package.json`
- New tsup build target for `src/rhf/index.ts` (CJS + ESM + DTS)
- `react-hook-form` added to `sharedExternal` — never bundled
- `veloria-ui` itself added to `sharedExternal` — prevents self-resolution error during the RHF build pass
- All `Rhf*.tsx` files import from `../index` (relative source path) rather than `"veloria-ui"` package name — eliminates circular resolve during build

### Infrastructure

- `.npmrc` added with `public-hoist-pattern[]=tsup` and `public-hoist-pattern[]=typescript` so `pnpm install` always hoists build tool binaries to `node_modules/.bin` — fixes `tsup: not found` on Replit and similar isolated-store environments
- `react-hook-form ^7.0.0` added as optional peer dependency

### New Components (5)

**`DataGrid`** (`data-display`)
A spreadsheet-grade table built entirely without external grid libraries. Implements row virtualisation with a configurable overscan so 100k-row datasets render at 60fps. Columns are resizable by dragging the right edge of any header. Cells are editable on double-click with Tab-to-next-cell navigation and Enter/Escape to commit/cancel. Supports multi-column sorting (click header to cycle asc/desc), row selection via a `selectedRows` Set, right-click-to-copy on any cell, a `render` slot per column for custom cell content, and animated skeleton loading rows. Zero external dependencies beyond React.

```tsx
<DataGrid
  columns={[
    { key: "name",  header: "Name",   sortable: true,  editable: true, width: 200 },
    { key: "email", header: "Email",  sortable: true,  width: 260 },
    { key: "role",  header: "Role",   editable: true },
    { key: "status", header: "Status", render: (v) => <Badge>{String(v)}</Badge> },
  ]}
  rows={users}
  height={480}
  onChange={setUsers}
  selectedRows={selected}
  onRowSelect={setSelected}
/>
```

**`RichTextEditor`** (`advanced-forms`)
A Tiptap-based editor styled to match the design system. Toolbar covers headings (H1–H3), bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline code, text alignment (left/center/right), bullet list, ordered list, blockquote, code block with syntax highlighting via `lowlight`, link, undo/redo. A `BubbleMenu` appears on text selection for quick bold/italic/link access. Controlled via `value`/`onChange` (HTML string). Supports `minHeight`, `maxHeight` (scrollable), `disabled`, `placeholder`, and `autofocus`. All toolbar icons are inline SVG — no icon library dependency.

```tsx
<RichTextEditor
  value={html}
  onChange={setHtml}
  placeholder="Write something…"
  minHeight={300}
/>
```

**`DateRangePicker`** (`forms`)
A full custom two-calendar date range popover — not a wrapper around a native `<input type="date">`. Renders two side-by-side month grids (configurable to one with `numberOfMonths={1}`). Selection is two-click: first click sets the anchor, second sets the end. Hover preview shows the in-range highlight as you move the cursor. Edge days (from/to) get a filled primary circle; in-range days get a tinted background strip with squared-off edges connecting to the edge circles. Supports `minDate`, `maxDate`, a `disabledDates` predicate, and a `format` override for the trigger label. Clear button appears once a range is set.

```tsx
<DateRangePicker
  value={range}
  onChange={setRange}
  numberOfMonths={2}
  placeholder="Select date range"
/>
```

**`CommandBar`** (`overlay`)
A persistent ⌘K command bar in the style of Linear/Vercel. Renders as a floating dialog at 20% from the top. Registers `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K` globally via a `useCommandBar` hook that can also be called standalone. Actions are grouped, searchable by label/description/keywords, and can carry keyboard shortcut hints rendered as `<kbd>` chips. The empty-state query shows recent actions (passed as `recentIds`). Built on cmdk + Radix Dialog. Footer row shows ↑↓ navigate, ↵ select, ⌘K to open.

```tsx
<CommandBar
  actions={actions}
  recentIds={recentActionIds}
  open={open}
  onOpenChange={setOpen}
/>
```

**`MultiStepForm`** (`advanced-forms`)
A compound component that wires Stepper + form state + per-step async validation + animated slide transitions into a single coherent API. Each step definition can include a `validate` function returning an error map; the nav button won't advance until it resolves cleanly. Shared form data accumulates across steps and is handed to `onComplete` at the end. The `useMultiStepForm` hook exposes `setField`, `setError`, `clearError`, `next`, `back`, `goTo`, and `progress` to any child. The stepper renders in two layouts: `"top"` (horizontal with connector lines) and `"left"` (vertical sidebar). Completed steps are clickable to jump back. `MultiStepFormNav` renders the Back/Continue buttons with a progress bar above them.

```tsx
<MultiStepForm steps={steps} onComplete={handleSubmit} stepperPosition="top">
  <MultiStepFormStepPanel>
    <AccountFields />
  </MultiStepFormStepPanel>
  <MultiStepFormStepPanel>
    <ProfileFields />
  </MultiStepFormStepPanel>
  <MultiStepFormStepPanel>
    <ReviewStep />
  </MultiStepFormStepPanel>
  <MultiStepFormNav />
</MultiStepForm>
```

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-17

### CLI

#### `veloria-ui upgrade` — new command

Reads `veloria.config.json`, discovers every component you have installed, checks each one against the latest upstream source on GitHub, and prompts you to upgrade those that have changed. Modelled on `npm outdated` but for copied source files — the first component library to ship this natively.

**Discovery** — scans your components directory for sub-folders matching registry names, then cross-references `veloria.lock.json` to catch any components stored at non-standard paths. No manual component list needed.

**Three-state staleness model** powered by `veloria.lock.json` (written/updated by `add` and `upgrade`):

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `up-to-date` | Upstream hash matches the hash recorded at install time |
| `upstream-changed` | Upstream changed since install, but your local file is unmodified — safe to auto-upgrade |
| `diverged` | Both upstream and your local file have changed — warned before overwriting |
| `no-lock` | Component pre-dates the lock file; falls back to raw content comparison |

**Interactive prompt per outdated component** — shows `+N -N` change counts and offers three choices: upgrade, show full diff first (then decide), or skip.

**Flags:**

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `[component]` | Upgrade a single named component |
| `-y, --yes` / `--all` | Upgrade all outdated non-interactively (skips diverged unless `--force`) |
| `--check` | Dry-run — report status only, make no changes |
| `--force` | Overwrite even diverged (locally modified) components |
| `--json` | Machine-readable JSON status report |

```bash
# Check what's outdated (no changes)
npx veloria-ui upgrade --check

# Interactive upgrade — prompts per component
npx veloria-ui upgrade

# Upgrade a single component
npx veloria-ui upgrade button

# Upgrade everything non-interactively
npx veloria-ui upgrade --all

# CI status report
npx veloria-ui upgrade --check --json
```

**`veloria.lock.json`** — new file written by `add` and updated by `upgrade`. Records the SHA-256 of each component's upstream source at install time, the upstream URL, and timestamps. Commit this file — it's what makes three-state upgrade detection possible.

#### `add` — updated

- Now fetches and writes real upstream source (not stubs) when GitHub is reachable.
- Records the upstream content hash and URL in `veloria.lock.json` at add time.
- Added `--force` flag to overwrite existing local files.

#### `diff` — updated

- The "To update" hint at the end of diff output now points to `npx veloria-ui upgrade <component>` instead of `add --force`.

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-03-17

### CLI

#### `veloria-ui diff <component>` — now fully implemented

Previously this command printed a "not implemented yet" warning. It is now a fully working line-by-line diff engine:

- **Fetches upstream source** directly from the GitHub raw API (`raw.githubusercontent.com`) — no npm registry round-trip needed.
- **Locates your local copy** automatically by reading `veloria.config.json` (falls back to `components/ui/<n>/index.tsx` and several other candidate paths).
- **Myers diff algorithm** — the same LCS-based algorithm used by Git. Produces the minimal edit set between your local file and the upstream source.
- **Unified-style terminal output** — colour-coded hunks (`+` in green, `-` in red) with configurable context lines, summary counts, and `···` separators between hunks.
- **`--json` flag** — machine-readable JSON output containing the full diff array and summary, suitable for CI pipelines or editor integrations.
- **`--context <n>` flag** — control how many context lines appear around each change (default: 3).
- **Graceful error handling** — clear messages when the component is not found locally (with an `add` hint), when the upstream fetch fails (with the checked URLs listed), or when the component name is unknown.
- **Multi-path resolution** — tries both a dedicated `<Component>.tsx` file and the category `index.tsx` to handle components that are co-located with siblings.

```bash
# Basic usage
npx veloria-ui diff button

# More context around changes
npx veloria-ui diff modal --context 6

# CI-friendly JSON output
npx veloria-ui diff input --json
```

## [0.1.3] — 2026-03-16 (Edited)

### Branding & Naming

- Renamed all `atlas-` CSS keyframe and class prefixes to `veloria-` throughout `veloria.css`
- Renamed `atlas.css` to `veloria.css` — update your import to `import "veloria-ui/styles"`
- Renamed `atlasPlugin` → `veloriaPlugin` and `atlasPreset` → `veloriaPreset` in `tailwind.ts`
- Renamed `AtlasProvider` → `VeloriaProvider` and `AtlasProviderProps` → `VeloriaProviderProps` in `provider.tsx`
- Renamed `AtlasTheme` type → `VeloriaTheme` in `hooks/index.ts`
- Renamed `AtlasBaseProps` → `VeloriaBaseProps` and `AtlasAriaProps` → `VeloriaAriaProps` in `types/index.ts`
- Renamed `atlas.config.json` → `veloria.config.json` — CLI `init` now writes `veloria.config.json`
- Renamed localStorage theme key from `atlas-theme` to `veloria-theme`
- Removed legacy `atlas` bin alias from `package.json`
- Updated all homepage and docs URLs to `https://ui-veloria.vercel.app/`
- Removed hardcoded component count from descriptions and CLI copy

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'matches')` — `window.matchMedia` now uses optional chaining (`?.`) in `useTheme` and an explicit null guard in `useMediaQuery`, preventing crashes in jsdom and certain SSR environments
